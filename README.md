## Documentation

For installation instructions, in-depth usage and deployment details, please take a look at the official [documentation](https://getspooky.github.io/laravelDash/#/).

## Requirements
LaravelDash has a few requirements you should be aware of before installing:

- Composer
- Laravel Framework 5.4+ 
- Laravel Mix
- Node.js & NPM

## Browser Support

LaravelDash supports reasonably recent versions of the following browsers::

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Firefox
- Opera
- Safari


## Usage

> üö® The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of PHP.

### Minute 1: Create the Laravel application

we assume that you have been able to set up your development environment. There are two ways to install Laravel project

- Via Laravel Installer
- Via Composer Create-Project

I will be using via composer to create new project

```sh
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog 
```

Laravel provides a quick way to scaffold all of the routes and views you need for authentication using one simple command:
```sh
php artisan make:auth
```

### Minute 2: Configuration

Firstly, make sure to create a new database and add your database credentials to your .env file :
```sh
APP_URL=http://localhost
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

### Minute 3: Install and Configure laravelDash

LaravelDash is super easy to install. After creating your new Laravel application you can include the laravelDash package with the following command:

```sh
composer require yal/laraveldash
```

LaravelDash will automatically register its service provider if you are using Laravel >=5.5. If you are using LaravelDash with Laravel 5.3 or 5.4, add LaravelDash‚Äôs service provider in your application‚Äôs config/app.php file:

```php
/*
 * Laravel dashboard Service Provider
 */
 \Yasser\LaravelDashboard\DashboardServiceProvider::class,
```

Next, you need to publish the laravelDash configuration file:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Yasser\LaravelDashboard\DashboardServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

### Minute 4: Running Migrations and Defining Relationships

Generated migrations are regular Laravel migrations , Run the migrations with:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

Database tables are often related to one another. For example, a blog post may have many comments, or an order could be related to the user who placed it. Eloquent makes managing and working with these relationships easy. so go to App\User.php and add UserRelation

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Yasser\LaravelDashboard\Traits\UserRelation;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable,UserRelation;

}
```

### Minute 5:Yah! You‚Äôre on LaravelDash !

To see it, you need to start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running the following command:php artisan serve and then head to `http://localhost:8000/Dashboard`

If you are unable to find any open GitHub issues addressing the problem you found, your next step will be to open a new one. (See the next section for reporting security issues.) your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix. Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.
